# Cli based Calculator

## Overview

This is a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations. It is command-line-based and relies solely on user input.

As a newcomer to the GO language, I wanted to start with a very simple concept. I have often overcomplicated things in my code as an opportunity to explore the fundamental concepts of this language, such as variable declarations, functions, and typed values.

## Resources

I wrote this code using official GO resources.
